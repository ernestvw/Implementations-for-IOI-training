# Implementations

This repository contains implementations of most of the algorithms and data structures that we encountered during our training for the 2017 International Olympiads in Informatics (IOI) in Iran, as part of the Dutch Team.

Collaborators:
- Ernest van Wijland
- Robert Koprinkov
- Arend Mellendijk

We will try to make our implementations as simple, clear, efficient and reusable as possible.
