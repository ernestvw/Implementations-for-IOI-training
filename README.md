# Implementations

This repository contains implementations of most the algorithms and data structures that we encountered during our training for the 2017 IOI in Iran, as part of the Dutch Team.

Collaborators:
- Ernest van Wijland
- Robert Koprinkov

We will try to make our implementations as simple, clear, efficient and reusable as possible.
